		ReittiGPS uses the API provided by the <a href="https://www.hsl.fi/en">Helsinki Region Transport</a> authority to offer journey planning services. Their privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://www.hsl.fi/en/privacy">https://www.hsl.fi/en/privacy</a> although it is mostly irrelevant for ReittiGPS because the app doesn't collect nor provide any personal information such as name, email address, age, gender or date of birth. HSL does receive the IP address of your device, as well as any location or address information you may provide when asking the app to plan your journey.

		ReittiGPS itself doesn't have any server-side components, nor does it use any third party tracking libaries.

	ReittiGPS uses the API provided by Helsinki Region Transport authority to offer journey planning services. Their privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://www.hsl.fi/en/description-of-the-file">https://www.hsl.fi/en/description-of-the-file</a> although it is mostly irrelevant because ReittiGPS doesn't collect any personal information such as name, age, gender or date of birth. They do receive the IP address of your device, as well as the location and address information used to calculate the suggested routes. ReittiGPS itself doesn't have a server-side component, nor does it use any third party tracking libaries.
